## Data {.smaller}

-   Datasets are from TidyTuesday and originally drawn from Data for Progress

-   Data looks specifically at businesses that contribute to anti-LGBTQ political campaigns

-   We use 3 out of the 7 total datasets:

    -   Static_list - most complete combined info from other datasets

    -   Contribution_data_all_states - info by individual contribution

    -   corp_by_politician - info on politician offices

## Question 1: What is the relationship between a company's status as a pride sponsor, whether they have an HRC pledge or not, and their contributions to anti-LGBTQ+ political campaigns?
